This project was inspired by my local games store, where we will often take each others models and role them off in a vacuum, basically a "1v1 me on rust" situation to see which would win. However I brought up to them that it would never be accurate since we'd have such a small sample size, and we'd need to run dozens more of these test to see which model is statistically better. 

My aim with this project is to keep everything as a manual entry, so even if data sheets get updated the application is still usable, outside any special rules that are unit specific. (I.e. hellblasters shooting on death, would be a unit specific rule that I wouldnt worry about adding). By the end, you should be able to input any model, select the number of simulated battles (probably a default of 1000 is what i suggest) and having a *Decently* accurate depiction of which models are strong vs what. 

Id also like to eventually incorporate some matplotlib functions so that the data can be tracked over time as the simulation goes on (or maybe just at the end idk). 

I wouldnt recommend ever downloading this because I am a shit programmer and learned everything off late night youtube binges and this will probably bsod your pc and wipe your harddrive somehow.

Thanks!
